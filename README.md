# Rubik's Cube Solver

The Rubik's Cube Solver is a Windows desktop application developed in C# using the WPF framework and XAML for the user interface. It provides an intuitive graphical interface for solving Rubik's Cube puzzles of various sizes.

## Features

- **Graphical Interface:** Offers a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Rubik's Cube and solver algorithms.
- **Cube Visualization:** Displays the Rubik's Cube puzzle in 3D, allowing users to manipulate and view the cube from different angles.
- **Solver Algorithms:** Implements various solving algorithms, such as beginner's method, CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL), and advanced methods.
- **Customization Options:** Allows users to customize the cube's colors, size, and initial state.
- **Step-by-Step Solving:** Guides users through the solving process with step-by-step instructions and animations.
- **Algorithm Optimization:** Optimizes solving algorithms for efficiency and speed, providing fast solutions for complex cubes.

## Technologies Used

- **C#:** Programming language used for the application's backend logic and algorithms.
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation):** Framework for building desktop applications with rich user interfaces.
- **XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language):** Markup language used for designing the application's graphical user interface.
- **3D Graphics:** Utilizes 3D graphics libraries or APIs for rendering the Rubik's Cube puzzle in the application.
- **Solver Algorithms:** Implements various solving algorithms, such as CFOP, Kociemba's algorithm, and beginner's method.
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** Design pattern for separating the application's logic (Model) from its presentation (View) and user interaction (ViewModel).

## Usage

To run the Rubik's Cube Solver application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file (`RubiksCubeSolver.sln`) in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.
3. Build the solution to restore dependencies and compile the application.
4. Run the application using the debugger or by pressing `F5`.
5. Use the graphical interface to input the initial state of the Rubik's Cube and choose solving options.
6. Click the "Solve" button to initiate the solving process and view the solution steps.
